## Graph Neural Network for Molecular Property Prediction

### Overview
This project utilizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict the molecular property of chemical compounds based on their molecular structure represented in SMILES notation. It employs PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric for model building and training.

### Features
- Data processing from SMILES to graph representation.
- Normalization of target properties for efficient training.
- GNN model implementation using PyTorch Geometric.
- Training script with early stopping and hyperparameter tuning.
- Prediction and evaluation scripts with visualization of results.
